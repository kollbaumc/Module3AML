# Module3AML
This was a project in Applied Machine Learning where we took data from the Howell data set.  We trained 3 different models (Decision Tree, SVM, and Neural Net).  We split the data by age (over and under 18).  We made models where we used weight to try to predict whether a subject was male or female.
