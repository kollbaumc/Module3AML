# Module3AML
This was a project in Applied Machine Learning where we took data from the Howell data set.  We trained 3 different models (Decision Tree, SVM, and Neural Net). We used these models and the attribute height to predict the weight of a subject in the data set.  We also tried other variations of the models, splitting by age in one instance.  We made models where we used weight to try to predict whether a subject was male or female.
